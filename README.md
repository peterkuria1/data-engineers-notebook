# Data Engineering collected notes

The following are some collected research, tutorials, lessons and rehearsals in my data engineering life.

Lets delve into each of the following(to demostrate the below algorithms and techniques in addition to native python 3, I will make use of data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-Learn, Pytorch, Jax and TensorFlow

1. Logarithm (Complexity Analysis)
2. Graph Traversals (BFS & DFS)
3. Binary Search
